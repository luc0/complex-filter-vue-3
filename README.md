# vue-filter (code-challenge) VUE 3

This is a filter for social media posts/accounts, that I made in Vue 3 for a coding challenge.

- There are many different type of filters (followers, likes, isPrivate), and different comparators. (greater than, is)
- All filters will be send by POST. (the example is working, but I hide the token and site, for security reasons.)

TODO:
- fix some styles
- fix the way it's getting the json.
